      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
        My research combines observational data from various telescopes with theoretical modeling to unlock the mysteries of these incredibly dense neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic fields.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Beyond research, I am passionate about science communication and public outreach. I regularly engage with audiences of all ages through public talks, school visits, and online platforms to share the wonders of astronomy.
